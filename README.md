**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**
It is a programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
SQL allows users to define, retrieve, and manipulate data stored in a database management system (DBMS).

**CRUD** stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that can be performed on data in a database using SQL or any other database management system.

*SQL can be divided into several categories based on the types of operations it performs:*

1.**DDL** (Data Definition Language): DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and schemas. Common DDL statements include:
-CREATE: Used to create a new database object, such as a table or view.
-ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.
-DROP: Used to remove a database object from the database.

2.**DML** (Data Manipulation Language): DML statements are used to manipulate data within the database. They are used to insert, retrieve, update, and delete records in database tables. Common DML statements include:
-SELECT: Used to retrieve data from one or more database tables.
-INSERT: Used to insert new records into a table.
-UPDATE: Used to modify existing records in a table.
-DELETE: Used to remove records from a table.

3.**DQL** (Data Query Language): DQL is a subset of DML and is specifically used for querying and retrieving data from the database. The most common DQL statement is SELECT, which allows you to retrieve data based on specified criteria.

4.**DCL** (Data Control Language): DCL statements are used to control access to the database and manage privileges. They are used to grant or revoke permissions to database users. Common DCL statements include:
-GRANT: Used to provide specific privileges to a user or role.
-REVOKE: Used to remove specific privileges from a user or role.
